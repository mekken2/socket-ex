An idiot's first work on Sockets


## How to Run

### Server: 
Run server.py script in a terminal or any host. It will start listening to the requests at the Port it is assigned to.

### Client:
Run as many client terminals as you would like to send messages to the server as it designed to handle multiple requests at once. So, Just Run client.py and the connection would be secured.


## About Server
* It will start at Port 5050 by deafult, you may assign different port by editing it in server.py
* Server will retrieve the default internet ip address on its own, you may change it to local(127.1.0.0) if you like.
